My TinyFS:
    It operates on a fix size block of 256 bytes. 
    Super Block: holds the magic number, root node ptr, and records free/used blocks.
    Root Node: contains directory entries 8 bytes for filename and 1 for ptr.
    Inode blocks: for metadata and data blocks.

    Format: Creates the disk file, initializes all blocks to zero. Writes the superblock and an empty root directory.
            Marks all blocks as free in the bitmap, except for the superblock and root directory which are marked as used.  

    Mount: Loads the superblock, verifies the magic number, and prepares the system for use.

    Creating & Opening a File:
        Searches the root directory for the file.
        If found, creates a file descriptor mapping for it.
        If not found:
            Allocates a new inode block and adds an entry to the root directory.
            Sets the new file’s metadata and returns its fd.

    Writing to a File:
        Checks the inode for an existing data block, or allocates a new one.
        Writes up to BLOCKSIZE (256) bytes of data into that block.
        Updates the inode’s file size and data block pointer.
        Updates the bitmap to mark the data block as used.
    
    Reading from a File:
        Reads the inode to find the data block and file size.
        Reads bytes from the data block, advancing the file pointer as needed.

    Seeking:
        Moves the file’s pointer (for the FD) to a specified offset, if within bounds.

    Deleting a File:
        Removes the file’s entry from the root directory.
        Zeros out the inode and data blocks.
        Marks those blocks as free in the bitmap.

    Directory Listing:
        Scans the root directory, returning all current file names.

    Additional Functionalities:
    ---------------------------
    Renaming:
        Searches for the old file name in the directory, ensures the new name is available, then updates the directory entry.

    Defragmentation:
        Moves data blocks to be packed immediately after inode blocks, updating inode pointers and the bitmap to keep the file system compact.

    Some limitation:
        No subdir
        small file dir
        No permissions
        No timestamps
        Fixed blocksizes
        No file links
