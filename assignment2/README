Quesitons:
	1. For what types of workloads does SRTN deliver the same turnaround times as
		 FIFO?

		The type of workload that yeilds the same turn-around from SRTN in comparsion
		to FCFS would be a list of processes that arrives in sequential order with a
		linearly increasing burst. This makes the preemption ineffective.

		Example:

		FIFO
		Process   Arrival   Burst
		P0        T=0       1T
		P1        T=1       1T
		P2        T=2       2T
		P3        T=3       3T
		P4        T=4       4T
		P5        T=5       5T
		P6        T=6       6T

		P0        0T        1T

		P3        1T        4T
		P4        3T        7T
		P5        6T        11T
		P6        10T       16T

	2. For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SRTN deliver the same response times 
		 as RR?

		The quantum length for RR must be equal to or greater than the largest burst
		time form the workload. In addition, all processes must arrive at the same time.
		Given those two condition, RR acts exactly like SRTN. This also makes both
		policies converge to FIFO.

		Response time = Start time - Arrival time. Given the workloads all start at
		T=0 and they behave like FIFO. Both Policies would yield the same response time
		for their respected same processes.

		Example:

		SRTN
		Process   Arrival   Burst
		P0        T=0       2T
		P1        T=0       1T
		P2        T=0       3T

	3. What happens to response time with SRTN as job lengths increase? Can you use the 
		 simulator to demonstrate the trend?
		
		As job lenghts increase so does their response time as the jobs with the
		greatest burst are constantly being pushed to the end or the queue.

		Example:

		SRTN
		Process   Arrival   Burst
		P0        T=0       10T
		P1        T=0       1T
		P2        T=1       2T
		P3        T=5       3T
		P4        T=4       4T

		P1        0T        1T
		P2        0T        2T
		P3        0T        3T
		P4        3T        7T

	4. What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write 
		an equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?

		Assume quantum is an infinitely scalable constant and all jobs arrived at
		the same time. The response time of the Jobs at the end will have a greater
		reponse time in contrast to the jobs before it.

		Equation: (N - 1) x q where N is the number of jobs and q is a quantum
							constant

		Example:
		RR Q=10000000
		Process   Arrival   Burst
		P0        T=0       8T
		P1        T=0       8T
		P2        T=0       8T
		P3        T=0       8T
		P4        T=0       8T
		P5        T=0       8T

		P3        24T       32T
		P4        32T       40T
		P5        40T       48T
